## DRV2605L Haptic Driver

This is a library for the DRV2605L Haptic Driver. It is based on
the [Adafruit DRV2605 library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_DRV2605_Library/).

The datasheet is available [here](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/drv2605.pdf) or [here](https://www.adafruit.com/datasheets/DRV2605.pdf).

A full listing of the effects can be found in the datasheet or with an
excerpt from Adafruit via their learning platform [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/assets/72593).

This code was tested with an Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040) and
a DRV2605L Haptic Driver.
